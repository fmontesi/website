<strong>Abstract</strong>
<div align="justify" style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 5px; width: 800px; padding: 10px">
  Choreography-based programming is a powerful paradigm for designing
  communicating systems, where the flow of communications between
  peers (endpoints) is specified with a <emph>global description</emph>.
  Due to their global nature, current choreography models can specify
  only the behaviour of closed systems, i.e., systems where the
  behaviour of all endpoints is known at design time.  This limitation
  prevents the usage of choreographies in real-world
  distributed scenarios where the ability to compose different systems
  whose implementation details are unknown (as "black boxes") can be
  crucial. This paper proposes a new model that supports
  a compositionality of choreographies. The key of our approach is
  the introduction of partial choreographies, which can mix global
  descriptions with communications among external peers.  
We prove that if two choreographies are composable, then the endpoints
independently generated from each choreography
are also composable, preserving their typability and deadlock-freedom.
The usability of our framework is demonstrated by modelling an industrial use 
case implemented in a framework for Web Services, Jolie.
