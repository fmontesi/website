	<h3>Thesis projects</h3>
	<p>
		You're welcome to contact me and inquire on available BSc and MSc thesis topics.
		I am interested in supervising projects about choreographic programming (in various languages, including the Choral programming language), the Jolie programming language, programming languages, cloud computing, cybersecurity, digital democracy and artificial intelligence (AI), and green computing.
		<!-- You can see some previous theses that I advised at this link: <a href="/theses.html">previous theses</a>. -->
