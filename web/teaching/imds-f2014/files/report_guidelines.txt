# Guidelines for the final report - Integrated and Mobile Distributed Systems 2014


## Packaging

You have to hand in a single zip file on Blackboard, containing:

- a PDF file with your report (call it "<your_name>-report-imds2014.pdf", where <your_name> should be
replaced by your name);
- a subdirectory named "code" containing the source code for your project.

Either in the report (Section "Technical Description", described below), or in a separate README
file pointed , include instructions for running


## Format

The report must not exceed 10 pages, all included.
Use 1.5 line spacing and ensure that the page margins are at least of 2cm (in all directions).
For the body text, use Times new roman as family and 12pt as font size.

The first page of the report must include a title, your name, your SDU e-mail address, the name of the course and the date.

Tip: if you use Latex, you can use the following command (adapt the margins to your liking, but respect the minimal specifications).
\usepackage[a4paper,top=2.1cm,bottom=2.1cm,left=2.4cm,right=2.4cm]{geometry}

## Structure

All reports should have the same main structure. Feel free to insert subsections as you see fit.
The main sections are given in the following list.

1 - Introduction.
This section gives an overview of the motivations and results of what you have done.
Describe the challenge that you want to address, motivating why it is relevant.

2 - Preliminaries.
Give a brief overview of the background knowledge needed to understand your report.
Provide references to what you have used and report the main concepts that your work is based on.

3 - Technical Description.
Here you explain the technical work you have carried out.
You may include code snippets where relevant, and refer to source code in the project files.

You should report on the structure of communications used in your work, and document them
appropriately. You may use any of the formalisms or languages seen in the lectures for describing
communication protocol structures (e.g., any variant of session types or the protocols in Chor).

This section must contain instructions for running the project. You can include them directly here
or point to a separate README file in the zip package that you hand in.

4 - Related Work and Discussion.
In this section you review the relevant state of the art. This may include alternative solutions to the
same challenge you have tried to address in your project, or alternative methodologies that you may
have followed (e.g., choice of other technologies for implementing the project).
Provide a discussion on the implications of your choices in the design of your work and the technologies/techniques
that you have used.

- References (or Bibliography)
This section should contain references to the articles/websites/resources/etc. cited in your report.

For citing scientific papers, you can find the relative Bibtex entries in DBLP. Look on google for “DBLP <name of the author>” and Export record as Bibtex in the hover menu for the second icon beside the entry you are interested in.
