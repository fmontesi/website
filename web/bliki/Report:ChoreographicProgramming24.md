[Choreographic Programming 2024](https://pldi24.sigplan.org/home/cp-2024) ended. It was the first full international workshop on choreographic programming, co-located with [PLDI 2024](https://pldi24.sigplan.org/).
I'm heading home now, with my spirit still filled with excitement and a head full of fresh ideas.

It's been, without a doubt, one of the best events I've ever participated in.
I mean, just look at [its program](https://pldi24.sigplan.org/home/cp-2024#program). Lots of work in progress on new features, foundations, logical methods, security, and applications. It'd make the mouth of every choreographic programming enthusiast water.
