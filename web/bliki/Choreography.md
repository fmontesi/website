A **choreography** is a coordination plan for processes that participate in concurrent and distributed systems [[Montesi 2023](#M23)].
It defines the communications that these processes are expected to perform, usually with the intention of reaching a common goal.

In computer science, choreographies are typically given in a [choreographic language](ChoreographicLanguage).
