In computer science, a **choreography** is a coordination plan for processes that participate in concurrent and distributed systems [[Montesi 2023](#M23)].
It defines the communications that these processes are expected to perform, usually with the underlying intention that these processes collabolate in order to achieve a joint goal.

Choreographies in computer science are not to be confused with choreographies in other fields. When disambiguation is necessary, the choreographies in computer science can be called 'Data Choreographies' (<https://youtu.be/B7MNZk1v37g>).

Choreographies are typically given in a [choreographic language](ChoreographicLanguage).

## Decentralised nature

By nature, choreographies do not require central control. They are often contrasted with the concept of orchestration, whereby a central coordinator (the orchestrator) invokes and composes the operations offered by the other processes in the system.

However, while choreographies do not **need** centralised control, this does not mean that all choreographies describe decentralised systems. It is indeed conceivable to write a choreography that describes an orchestrated system.
