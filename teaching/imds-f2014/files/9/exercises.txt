Preparation
- Install Eclipse
- Install Chor from the Eclipse Marketplace

Exercise 1

Modify the simple.cho example:
- add a new process to session k, logger;
- after the server receives the message from client, make the server send the received message
to logger instead of printing it on screen;
- make logger print the message on screen.


Exercise 2:

- Compile your modified version of simple.cho;
- go in the code of the logger;
- instead of printing the message received from the server on screen,
have the logger append it to a file called "log.txt".
(Suggestion: use the writeFile@File operation that you can include from "file.iol"
in the Jolie standard library).
