Write a Chor program where:

Exercise 1:
- A process "user" authenticates to a process "proxy" using the OpenID protocol from openid.cho (use "ip" for the identity provider process name); if authentication is successful, the following should happen:
- the proxy opens a new session, called "stream", with a streaming server, called "streamer";
- the proxy delegates session stream to the user;
- streamer sends a stream to user, similarly to how it is done in stream.cho

Exercise 2:
- Compile the choreography from exercise 1, if you have completed it, or from stream.cho otherwise.
- Modify the Jolie code of the streamer such that instead of asking for input from the user, it reads the content of a text file "content.txt" and uses this content for the packets in the stream.
