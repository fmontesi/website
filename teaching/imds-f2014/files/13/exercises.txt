Modify main.ol in db.zip such that:
- main.ol offers a new operation, query, for running arbitrary SQL queries on the database. The operation should check
that the client has valid credentials according to the database, and return the result of the query to the client.
- Add an HTML form that the client can use to send invocations for the query operation (look at the example on HTML forms from the previous lecture).
